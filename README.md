# ui_shield

These are PCB design-files, in an ancient KiCad format, that implement an Arduino user-interface shield.

The shield fits on a classic (Duemilanove/Uno) and supports:
 - a simple power supply
 - a single 5V relay-driver output
 - pin headers for an HD44780 LCD, with backlight brightness control
 - a quadrature rotary encoder with button-press (on raised daughterboard)
 - a 4x4 keypad,
 - daughterboards for TSL230 and TSL235 light sensors,
 - a few spare input pins

It is used to build an [f/stop enlarger timer](https://www.brodie-tyrrell.org/fstoptimer/).
